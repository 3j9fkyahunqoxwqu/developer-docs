# Fixing a Bug

All the issues, bugs, work in progress patches, or updates related to Thunderbird, are listed on [BugZilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org), and are properly organized per **Product**, **Component**, and **Status**.

## Create a BugZilla account

Creating an account is necessary in order for you to submit patches, leave comments, and interact with any other aspect of BugZilla. If you're currently using an `IRC` username in the `#maildev` channel, we recommend saving your profile name with the current format `Firstname Lastname (:username)`.

## Find a Bug

Use the [Advanced Search](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?format=advanced) section to find bugs you want to take care of, and be sure the bug doesn't currently have any user listed as *Assignee* and the *Status* is set to `NEW`.

## Search for code references

Making sense of the **Thunderbird** source code, and knowing where to look, will take some time. The code base is pretty extensive and if never worked with `XBL` and `Custom Elements` it can be overwhelming at first. We recommend using our code search engine, [SearchFox](https://searchfox.org/comm-central/source/), to inspect the source code and find snippets and references to use while investigating a bug.
